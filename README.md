# Criteria4s Presentation

This repository is for the presentation of the Criteria4s library. The presentation is divided into two modules:

- **ppt**. [Presentation](ppt/criteria4s-ppt.pdf): The presentation slides.
- **code**. [Different Criteria4s approach implementations](src/main/scala/io/github/rafafrdz/criteria4s/presentation): Different implementations (for every approach) of the Criteria4s library.
- **api**. [API with Criteria4s](server/README.md): A simple API that uses the Criteria4s library to filter reviews data from two databases (mongodb and postgresql).
